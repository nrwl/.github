adopted (4+ million downloads/week) and has a vibrant community of contributors.

# Lerna

We took [over stewardship of Lerna in May 2022](https://blog.nrwl.io/lerna-is-dead-long-live-lerna-61259f97dbd9) when the project was officially announced to be abandoned. We have deep expertise in our team when it comes to monorepos, developer tooling and open source. So it was a good fit for us and we decided to revive the project. Since then we've kept releasing bug fixes, security fixes and major features and improvements across the board.
